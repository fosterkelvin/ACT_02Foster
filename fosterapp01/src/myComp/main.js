                        Why we need action</h3>
                        <p>Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and 
                            countries dearly today and even more tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>People are experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, which include changing weather patterns, rising sea level, and more extreme weather events.
                            The greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are driving climate change and continue to rise. They are now at their highest levels in history. 
                            Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and is likely to surpass 3 degrees Celsius this 
                            century—with some areas of the world expected to warm even more. The poorest and most vulnerable people are being affected the most.</p>

                            A race we can win</h3>
                <p>Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is quickening as more 
                    people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.</p>
                <p>But climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions 
                    that need to be coordinated at the international level and it requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.</p>
                <p>To address climate change, countries adopted the&nbsp;
                    <a title="Paris Agreement Signing Ceremony – 22 April 2016" href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/parisagreement22april/">Paris Agreement</a> 
                    at the&nbsp;<a title="UN Climate Change Conference Paris 2015" href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cop21/">COP21 in Paris&nbsp;
                    </a>on 12 December 2015. The Agreement entered into force less than a year later. In the agreement, all countries agreed to work to limit global temperature 
                    rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and given the grave risks, to strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
                <p>Implementation of the Paris Agreement is essential for the achievement of the&nbsp;<a title="Sustainable Development Goals" 
                href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a>, and provides a roadmap for climate actions that 
                will reduce emissions and build climate resilience.</p>

            <p>The Working Group III report provides an updated global assessment of climate change mitigation progress and pledges, and examines the sources of global emissions. 
                It explains developments in emission reduction and mitigation efforts, assessing the impact of national climate pledges in relation to long-term emissions goals.
